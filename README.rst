TuxLayers
========

TuxLayers is a command line tool to generate and manage hierarchical text and folder structures. It is based on git repositories, especially ones with multiple nested submodules.

For details on usage and examples please refer to the docs folder of the repository; it also contains a todo file containing ideas for extensions and/or features that will be implemented in the near future.

Requirements
------------

We obviously need a running python instance; since we need annotations for this project the minimum python version is 3.9.

Besides that, we only need pip to install the required libraries::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
