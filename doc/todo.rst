Feature ideas
=============

- Replace the layer tree with a DAG implementation so we can have multiple parents instead (think of feature mixins). Find a clever way to select which path to use through the graph when selecting a layer for patchset creation.
- Add example project / layer set to use in the documentation (and provide the repositories to play around with it)
- Allow for existing folders / files when creating (check for empty folder though)
- Synchronize all configuration throughout the application. Currently this is a tiny bit fragmented.
- Add test coverage to the main functionalities (and set up a dummy repositories for this and demonstrations)
